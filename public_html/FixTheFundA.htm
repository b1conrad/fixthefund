To have such an announcement would be tantamount to publicly admitting there were problems to begin with,
and the United States government does not like to admit they did anything wrong.  (Does anybody?)&#160;&#160;There is
also the issue of bringing the whole issue of the Fund back up in the public eye across the entire U.S., which
would be problematic as the Oklahoma City bombing victims did not get such a fund.  (There were no critical
industries to protect from lawsuits.)  So, you shall have to go by what I will tell you in the paragraphs below.</span></span></span></p>

Therefore, if you are not sure about participating in the Fund, you can change your mind and withdraw the
application to participate in a lawsuit.  (But, please read below about the wisdom of choosing the Fund over
suing.)  Here is a link to a PDF form.  Part I.&#160;a.&#160;is the first page, that is all you have to fill out now.  Everything

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">It is worthwhile to understand the real reason the Fund was established, as that may make it easier to consider
participation.  Shortly after the attacks, American and United airlines were handed their 30-day insurance
cancellation notice, this being due to the potential threat of lawsuits against them and others.  Under U.S. law,
one can sue based on the &#8220;contributory negligence&#8221; theory of law as well as &#8220;intentional harm&#8221; theory.  In this
case, it is the former that the airlines could be sued on.  With no insurance, the financiers of the aircraft who
lend the airlines money for their planes would demand that they be grounded.  So, in one fell swoop, America&#8217;s
two largest airlines are totally out of business.  In terms of passengers, cargo, and airline employees, this alone
would have been a national crisis with international repercussions.  </span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">But there was another crisis that would have been created.  Because Boeing, the manufacturer of the aircraft,
and all the subcontractors who contributed in the making of those aircraft can also be made liable under U.S.
tort law, the stocks of American Airlines and United Airlines, as well as these other companies would have been
pummeled.  This would have carried over to the entire Dow Jones transportation and manufacturing indexes and
that could precipitate a world financial crisis.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">For these reasons, legal protection had to be set up around the airlines limiting their liability; in this case,
Congress chose the amount of liability insurance the airlines carried.  When Congress did that, it reduced or
deprived the victims or their family of their right to seek redress of damages.  This would run afoul of the
Constitution&#8217;s guarantee of the right of due process and also, equal protection under the law.  If they didn&#8217;t do
something to replace the lost rights, the entire airline bailout package could have been challenged in court and
thrown out.  There were also moral and sympathy considerations involved, but the creation of the VCF was
primarily one of legal necessity.  </span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">The condition for joining the Fund is that one must waive their right to sue the airlines, and most other
U.S.&#160;entities such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or the airport security companies.  If you
join the Fund, you do retain the right to sue the terrorists or any foreign entities that supported the terrorists.  </span></span></span></p>

truth of why it happened to come out in, what is called, the &#8220;discovery phase&#8221; of a lawsuit.  Others think they
will get more money from a lawsuit because they think their award from the Fund will be very small, based on
the written regulations.  These two areas are where I need to provide you explanation so you can make a well-informed decision.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">With regards to &#8220;getting the truth out&#8221; by being involved in a lawsuit, that will happen regardless of whether or
not any one individual participates in the litigation.  There are about 69 people suing right now, and it only takes
a handful to push that suit forward.  There is a strong expectation that several of the 69 will drop out of the suit
and join the Fund, but that still leaves a strong number remaining.  Then, there is the fact that it is unknown
whether anyone not on the aircraft has standing to sue.  The Hon.&#160;Alvin K. Hellerstein, the federal judge on the
case, has not made a ruling in this matter.  Legal experts are not at all sure how it will turn out.  So, unless your
loved one was on one of the four aircraft that were used in the attacks, there is doubt as to whether you will be
allowed to participate in a lawsuit against the airlines, et.&#160;al.</span></span></span></p>

Mr.&#160;Kenneth Feinberg, the Special Master of the Fund, must deduct insurance from the gross award.  He has no
say in this matter as it was written into the law by Congress.  The combination of the low presumed
noneconomic damages, or &#8220;pain and suffering&#8221; award, and the insurance deductions have left many well-insured
people relying on Mr.&#160;Feinberg&#8217;s $250,000 floor to get any money from the Fund.  The reality of the matter is
not in the written rules, but rather in what Mr.&#160;Feinberg is doing in practice.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">There has been considerable pressure on the Special Master to change the rules and alter his handling of the
Fund.  Along with that, he now has much more experience with the September 11<sup>th</sup> families than when he first
started.  He may have been the most experienced man in the U.S. in handling mass tort situations, but in the
past, Mr.&#160;Feinberg had dealt only with victims&#8217; lawyers, and then, did so 15-25 years after the incident.  Now,
he is dealing directly with the victims&#8217; families and started doing so less than 15 weeks after the disaster.  The
result is a major change in Mr.&#160;Feinberg&#8217;s attitude.  He is now a more compassionate man and is looking for
every legitimate way to increase the awards.  He doesn&#8217;t always come across that way in groups, but I&#8217;ve had
conversations with him and I believe he is sincere.  </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">With regards to the noneconomic damages, he recognizes the extent of pain that both our loved ones and we
have gone through.  He recognizes that we have gone through much more pain and suffering than could have
been imagined when he wrote the Rules and Regulations in November 2001.  But, in his words, &#8220;it is too late in
the day to modify the public rules and regulations of the Fund.&#8221;  What he is trying to do in individual cases is to
increase awards through the exercise of the discretionary power given him in the VCF legislation.  In case after
individual case, whether it is an appeal from Track A or a Track B hearing, he is listening to claimants so he can
honor their requests for an increase.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">I know this may seem strange to you, but it is the only way he can do it.  The December&#160;22 deadline precludes
modifying the rules because of the requirement of a public comment period when the public rules are changed. 
There just isn&#8217;t enough time.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">So, what should you do?  I suggest you file with the Fund and <span style="font-weight: bold">ask for more than the charts call for</span>.  He is
very interested in having as many families come into the Fund as possible because of the handwriting on the
wall with regards to lawsuits.  He sees participation in the Fund as allowing families to &#8220;close the door&#8221; on a big
portion of this mess, which will allow some emotional healing to come sooner.  A 10-year court battle might
take many older parents right to their grave without any resolution.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">Another suggestion I have is do not file on your own.  This is an emotional process, and you are unfamiliar with
what you should be compensated for.  Hire a lawyer, and opt for a paid lawyer rather than a free Trial Lawyers
Care (TLC) lawyer.  While there are good TLC lawyers doing the work pro bono, or for free, many jumped in to
help with all good intentions, but found out later they bit off more than they can chew.  If a paying job comes in
and the firm needs your lawyer&#8217;s time, guess who gets short-changed?  </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">This is not the simple process that everyone made it out to be in the beginning.  Yes, it is non-adversarial,
meaning that there are no challenges to what you present.  Nevertheless, there are many nuances that, if
overlooked, will cost you a lot of lost award money.  Hire a lawyer that is doing at least 15-25 other cases.  Pay
them their small percentage so you will get the attention you deserve and the case presented in the best possible
manner.  </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">I would suggest talking to experienced firms, especially New York City firms, that have a good amount of
cases.  As their earlier cases work their way through the system, they get a &#8220;reading&#8221; on what works and what
doesn&#8217;t.  There is nothing like experience to help you better prepare the next case.  I am working with Kreindler
&amp; Kreindler, one of the top firms, because my case is complicated: my wife was my business partner as well as
an employee for Marsh &amp; McLennan.  I&#8217;ve heard good things about Speiser Krause, also.  Both firms are in
Manhattan.  This doesn&#8217;t mean other firms aren&#8217;t good, I just haven&#8217;t had any personal dealings with the others.  
If you&#8217;re with one that you&#8217;re comfortable with and has a number of other VCF cases, then I&#8217;d stick with them. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">The deadline for filing is <span style="font-weight: bold">Dec.&#160;22, 2003</span>; it would take an act of Congress to extend it, and the likelihood of that
happening appears remote at this time.  The Special Master is staying open through June&#160;14,&#160;2004 to process
claims.  He is allowing people who are, or think they want to, sue the airlines, etc., to file Part I.&#160;a.,&#160;and make
their final decision later on.  He just doesn&#8217;t want anybody to get locked out because of the statutory deadline.</span></span></span></p>

and, perhaps, emotional issue:  That is the issue of feeling &#8220;guilty&#8221; about &#8220;profiting&#8221; from your loved ones death
&#8212; that the money from the Victim Compensation Fund is &#8220;blood money.&#8221;  Well, I suppose then that life
insurance is &#8220;blood money,&#8221; too.  But before you turn down the money, I&#8217;d like to you consider this scenario.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">Let&#8217;s be conservative and say your &#8220;award&#8221; from the Fund would be $1 million.  And let&#8217;s say you are at the
craps, or baccarat table in Las Vegas and you are up $1 million and you blow it.  Would you be mad at yourself? 
Would you kick yourself all the way home?</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">That is exactly what you are doing by turning away from the Fund.  Nothing is going to bring my Katherine
back, nor will your loved one come back.  Life has changed.  But you have this one chance to get a pot of
money and do something wonderful with it.  Properly invested in a bond portfolio, $1 million would pay
$47,000 annually in interest income.  That could pay for retirement, provide health insurance for several people
or help pay off debts.  (The investment management firm I am using has impecible credentials.  Contact me if
you&#8217;d like their name.)</span></span></span></p>

fortunate.  My point is, this is an opportunity you will throw away if you don&#8217;t apply.  </span></span></span></p>
