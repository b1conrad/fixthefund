# fixthefund
snapshot of fixthefund.org

## Why make a snapshot?
- an off-site backup of the documents held by the official site
- preparation for hosting the official site on a different web server
- an additional place where historians and scholars can peruse these important documents

## Method
- an archive file `public_html.tar.gz` was created on the server of the official site
- all of the files of the official site were expanded from it and pushed into this repo
- the folder `public_html` was renamed to `docs`
- a duplicate of the official site was published using GitHub pages
- file sizes and dates are available in `datestamps.tsv` and [here]([200~https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gdpoklzjoFb9ztInTK5vmnMCbCfs_htMW-FvLnkjpuo/edit?usp=sharing)
